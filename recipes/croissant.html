    <p>Croissants are iconic French pastries known for their crescent shape, buttery flavor, and flaky texture. Made from laminated dough, they have multiple layers that create a light, airy interior and a crisp, golden-brown exterior. Perfectly paired with a hot cup of coffee, croissants are a breakfast staple and a popular choice for any time of the day.</p>
